Cyber Security
Cyber Security - SOC , SEIM, XDR
Security Operations Center (SOC)
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Extended Detection and Response (XDR)

Comparison: SOC vs. SIEM vs. XDR
Feature	SOC	SIEM	XDR
Purpose	Centralized monitoring and response	Log aggregation and analysis	Unified threat detection and response
Focus Area	Incident response and management	Log analysis, threat detection	Multi-layer security (endpoints, cloud, etc.)
Tools Used	SIEM, EDR, SOAR	SIEM tools (Splunk, QRadar, etc.)	XDR platforms (CrowdStrike, Cortex, etc.)
Benefits	24/7 monitoring, proactive defense	Compliance, centralized logging	Holistic threat detection, automated response
Challenges	High operational cost, skilled staff	Complex setup, false positives	Integration complexity, vendor lock-in

Password Lists for Brute-Forcing Tools
Penetration testers often use publicly available password lists with tools like Hydra, John the Ripper, or Burp Suite for brute-forcing attempts.

Some popular password lists include:

rockyou.txt - Available in Kali Linux (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt)
SecLists - A comprehensive collection of wordlists (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
10-million-password-list - Available on GitHub for extensive testing.
